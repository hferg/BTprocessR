2) incoporate reading of fixed rates, and including them in the output of rjpp (i.e. making sure they are always represented in the esimates). This is harder - perhaps not doable? - for transformations.
3) incoporate the detection and plotting of reconstructed ancestral states
4) tree-slicing plots, i.e. rates through time and traits through time (only if full ancestral state reconstruction is provided - need to incorporate a check for that).
5) implement ArgumentCheck to check arguments for all functions in the package - big task! Worth doing though I suspect. It might not be super useful for ALL functions, but there are some where it really is going to be handy.
6) the cex values for node scalars seem to have got messed up - check this out.
